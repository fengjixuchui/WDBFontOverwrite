Proof-of-concept app to overwrite fonts on iOS using [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213530).

Works on iOS 16.1.2 and below (tested on iOS 16.1) on unjailbroken devices.

IPA available in the [Releases](https://github.com/zhuowei/WDBFontOverwrite/releases) section.

I'm probably not going to work on this further. If anyone else wants to take over, feel free.

Fonts included:

- DejaVu Sans Condensed
- DejaVu Serif
- DejaVu Sans Mono
- Go Regular
- Go Mono
- Fira Sans
- Segoe UI
- Comic Sans MS
- Choco Cooky

You can also import custom fonts that were ported for iOS.

## Known issues

 - The built-in fonts are not properly ported (I don't know how to port fonts). For best results, use a custom font.
   - with the built-in fonts:
   - Only regular text uses the changed font: thin/medium/bold text falls back to Helvetica instead.
   - If the font doesn't show up at all, [disable "Bold Text"](https://twitter.com/m7mdabu7assan/status/1607609484901289985) in accessibility settings.
 - File pickers in apps will fail to open with the error "Something went wrong while displaying documents."
   - This happens if you replace the emoji font, or install fonts with [multiple weights](https://twitter.com/Gu3hi/status/1607986473198026752)
   - These fonts use the .ttc format, which breaks the files picker.
   - No workaround yet - you'll need to remove the custom font by rebooting.
   - It may be possible to convert a .ttc font to a .ttf font with tools such as https://github.com/DavidBarts/getfonts: I have not tested if this would fix the issue.
 - Custom font imports may not work: tapping on a font to import it [doesn't do anything](https://twitter.com/linshijin111/status/1607993438997446657)
   - No workaround yet. The built-in fonts should still work.
 - Importing a custom font from some cloud storage apps' file storage providers, such as Google Drive's file provider, crashes the app with a "The file doesn't exist" error.
   - Workaround: use the Files app to copy the font to your Downloads folder first.

## Font conversion

The CVE-2022-46689 issue - as far as I know - only lets you overwrite 16383 bytes out of every 16384 bytes: the last byte of the page can't be written.

(I could be wrong)

To work around this, I package the font using the [WOFF2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/) webfont format, which is [supported on iOS](https://twitter.com/myunderpants/status/1503745380365877252). WOFF2 uses [Brotli](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932) for compression, which lets me insert padding to skip over the last byte.

See `repackfonts/make_woff2src.sh` for details: this script:

- renames the font to .SFUI-Regular with [TTX](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) following [this answer](https://superuser.com/a/694452)
- rebuilds the font to .woff2
- runs `repackfonts/BrotliPadding.swift` to decompress the WOFF2 file and insert padding to skip past the 16384th byte
